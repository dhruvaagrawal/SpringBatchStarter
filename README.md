# SpringBatchStarter

## Part 3

*This is Part 3 of a series of Github repository pushes that I have started, to learn new things (primarily Java and Python, and a little bit of Node.js if time permits) and keep up with what I have already learnt.*

This is a very simple project where there is a single API at the endpoint *"/jobs"*, which reads a particular CSV file and then processes it and dumps it into a MySQL DB.

This project uses Spring Boot, Spring Batch, JPA and MySQL.

## Steps to run the code:

*mvn spring-boot:run*
